X-Note:
 The original LZMA is public domain. Con Kolivas has extended it
 and released changes under GPL-3+.
 .
 The ASM code compiling has been disables in this debian
 package, so file ./C/7zCrcT8.c is not used.
X-License-Comment:
 [from https://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html]
 "License: LZMA SDK is placed in the public domain."
 .
 [from lzma/README]
 JANUARY 2009
 .
 This is an updated LZMA library wrapper provided with SDK 4.63.
 The SDK is available here: https://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html.
 .
 It is written completely in C and compilation and integration
 is much simpler. To enable multithreading support, compile
 with COMPRESS_MF_MT and _REENTRANT defined. MF=Match Finder,
 MT=Multi Thread. In addition, link in pthread. This is default
 behavior in lrzip. For single thread support, remove these
 defines in the Makefile.
 .
 Some additional documentation is provided from the SDK.
 .
 File ./C/7zCrcT8.c is added to support ASM CRC code. Taken
 from p7zip.org.
 .
 Original README text follows.
 .
 This is a zlib like library for the lzma encoder/decoder originally created
 by Oleg I. Vdovikin <oleg@cs.msu.su> and modified for lrzip by Con Kolivas
 <kernel@kolivas.org>
 It is based on a stripped down source tree of the lzma SDK by Igor Pavlov.
 https://www.7-zip.org
 .
 You can build a standalone library called liblzma.a which gives functions
 equivalent to compress2() and uncompress() called lzma_compress() and
 lzma_uncompress().
 .
 Updated for recent SDK 4.57 and added assembler routines for crc
 using p7zip.org variant by Peter Hyman
